## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Outfit Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- A bit of Googling

### What I learned

This was a great opportunity to recap the basics of HTML and CSS. I had a lovely time using the vanilla layouts and rules, and I'm proud of the result!

### Continued development

It's so interesting figuring out all the ways elements can be aligned and positioned. I'm particularly interested in learning as much as I can about Flexbox.

From now on, I'll be focusing on using Tailwind CSS where possible.

## Acknowledgments

This is one of my very first complete projects, and this journey all started thanks to Northcoders. They have done a great job teaching me and the rest of the cohort on the JavaScript Bootcamp. I can't wait to learn more and present more projects soon!
